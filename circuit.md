# Circuit

## Voltage		| unit of measure: volt(V) |	 Ohm's law symbol: E
	The difference in electrical potential energy, per unit of charge, between two points
	E = IR

## Current		| unit of measure: amp(A) | 	Ohm's law symbol: I
	The rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit
	I = E/R

## Resistance | unit of measure: ohm(Î©) | 	Ohm's law symbol: R
	The measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit
	R = E/I
