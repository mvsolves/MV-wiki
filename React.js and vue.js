# React.js and vue.js
	if you only ever use one framework, you will inherently
	start thinking about your solutions in terms of that
	framework and it will become your crutch instead of your power.
	
	Learning or knowing two frameworks at once can invert this
	thinking and give you more perspective into what the framework
	is actually doing for you.
