## Solving the Compiler and Missing Header File Issues Using Cmake.
A quick update. So how I managed to fix the cpp compiler and header files issue was actually quite simple.

All I had to do was generate a compiler_commands.json file.

This is generated by placing this command in CMakeLists.txt:
	set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)

Once the build starts, this compiler_commands.json
file will be generated and will be recognized by using:
	- Native LSP that comes with NeoVim (Language Server Protocol)
	- Clangd (what understands C++)



## Solving the Mixxx Compiler Issue on a Mac M1

Simply place this command within the CMakeLists.txt file:
	set(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES "x86_64")
	
A quick and dirty way to be able to compile on Mac M1 ;)
