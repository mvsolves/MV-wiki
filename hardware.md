# Networking -> hardware

## Modem (modulator demodulator)
	- Demodulates incoming analog signals into an digital signal
	- Modulates outgoing digital signals into an analog signal

## Cable modems
	- Typically provided by same company that provides you with cable television
	- Connected to home using a quax cable

## DSL modems
	- Typically provided by same company that provides you with Internet Service Provider 

## WiFi router (passes internet connection to all your devices)
	- Routers come in after the modem
	- Usually will have a built-in switch to connect to multiple devices via ethernet
	- Also functions as wireless access point
	- Can log into wifi routers to make changes?

## Hub (Routes data to all ports)
	- Does not filter data or have intelligence on where data is suppose to be sent
	Example: ([X] is data)
		----[X]--> |-------|--[X]-->
		---------> | HUB	 |--[X]-->
		---------> |-------|--[X]-->
	
## Switch
	- Similar to a hub
	- A switch is intelligent
	- Stores physical address (MAC address)
	- When a data packet is sent to a switch, it's only directed to the inteded destination port

## Wireless access point (relays data between a wired network and wireless devices)

	
## PoE injector (Allow network admin to add a power supply to an ethernet cable)
